## Features
- **Automated Feeding:** Dispenses food based on set schedules or remote commands.
- **Pet Interaction:** Includes motion detection and audio playback to engage pets.
- **Remote Control:** Web interface enables monitoring and interaction from any device.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Efficient wireless communication via nRF24 for power savings.

## System Architecture
The system comprises:
1. **Master Node (ESP32):** Controls the web interface and manages communication with slave nodes.
2. **Slave Nodes (STM8):** Handle feeding mechanics, motion detection, and audio playback.
3. **Wireless Communication:** nRF24 module for robust, low-power communication between nodes.

## Hardware Components
- **ESP32-S3**: For web server and master node functions.
- **STM8S105K4**: Controls slave nodes for feeding and interaction.
- **nRF24L01**: Wireless communication module.
- **Motion Sensor (HC-SR501)**: Detects pet presence.
- **Servo Motor (MG996R)**: Operates food dispenser.
- **Load Cell (HX711)**: Measures food weight.
- **DFPlayer Mini MP3 Module**: Plays audio for pet engagement.
- **Power Supply**: USB-powered with 5V-3.3V step-down regulator.

## Software Components
- **ESP32 Web Server**: Provides an interface for users to monitor and control the feeder.
- **nRF24 Communication Protocol**: Enables low-power data exchange between nodes.
- **FreeRTOS on ESP32**: Manages concurrent tasks for seamless operation.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Hardware Assembly**:
   - Connect the ESP32 and STM8 modules with the required sensors and actuators as per the system diagram.
   - Install the nRF24 module for wireless communication.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Flash the ESP32 and STM8 with the respective firmware.
   - Connect to the web server through the ESP32â€™s Wi-Fi network for initial configuration.

3. **Usage**:
   - Use the web interface to set feeding schedules, enable interaction features, and monitor system logs.
